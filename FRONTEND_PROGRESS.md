## Current Issues to Resolve

### 1. Tailwind CSS Static Files (CRITICAL)
**Error:** `Not Found: /static/css/dist/styles.css`
**Cause:** Tailwind CSS files not being compiled/generated
**Solution:** Run `python manage.py tailwind install` and `python manage.py tailwind build`

### 2. URL Routing Issue (CRITICAL)
**Error:** `NoReverseMatch: Reverse for 'detail' with arguments '('mactast1c',)' not found`
**Cause:** User detail URL expects `pk` (primary key) but receiving `username`
**Solution:** Update template to use `user.pk` instead of `user.username` or modify URL pattern
