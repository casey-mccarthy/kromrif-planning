# Task ID: 9
# Title: Discord Integration and Member Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement Discord bot API endpoints and member status synchronization
# Details:
Create DRF API endpoints for roster queries, member status updates, and audit logging. Implement member linking/unlinking via Discord ID. Set up Django signals for automatic Discord webhook notifications on status changes. Create custom DRF permissions for bot access. Implement error handling and retry mechanisms for external API calls.

# Test Strategy:
Test all Discord integration endpoints work correctly and member status changes trigger appropriate notifications

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create DRF API endpoints for roster and member management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement Django REST Framework API endpoints to handle Discord roster operations and member data management

Create models and services to associate Discord user IDs with internal member records, handle OAuth flows, and manage link/unlink operations with proper validation.

## 3. Develop Django signals for webhook notifications [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Implement Django signal handlers to process Discord webhook events and trigger appropriate responses
### Details:
Create signal receivers for Discord events like member joins/leaves, role changes, and message events. Include proper event validation and processing logic.

## 4. Create custom DRF permissions for bot access [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement custom Django REST Framework permission classes to control Discord bot API access
### Details:
Design and implement permission classes that authenticate Discord bots, validate bot permissions, and restrict access to appropriate API endpoints based on bot roles.

## 5. Build error handling and retry mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Implement comprehensive error handling and retry logic for Discord API interactions
### Details:
Create error handling for Discord API rate limits, network failures, and webhook processing errors. Implement exponential backoff retry mechanisms and proper logging for debugging.
