# Task ID: 11
# Title: Frontend Implementation with Tailwind CSS and HTMX
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create modern, responsive web frontends for character management and guild roster functionality using Tailwind CSS and HTMX with proper static file compilation and URL routing.
# Details:
✅ COMPLETED: Tailwind CSS static file compilation issues have been resolved. The django-tailwind setup is now fully working with npm dependencies installed, CSS properly compiled to theme/static/css/dist/styles.css, and 404 errors resolved. The website now loads with proper Tailwind styling including responsive design, component library integration, and all template classes (cards, navigation, messages, etc.).

NEXT PHASES:
Phase 2: Character Management UI - Implement responsive list views, detailed character cards, and HTMX-powered create/edit forms building on the now-working Tailwind foundation.
Phase 3: Guild Roster dashboard with rank management interface, member search/filtering, and real-time updates via HTMX.
Phase 4: Reusable component library including HTMX-enhanced forms, modal dialogs, toast notifications, and loading states.
Phase 5: Enhanced interactivity with progressive enhancement, smooth transitions, and optimistic UI updates.

Ensure all templates continue to follow established patterns with proper CSRF handling, role-based styling, and Alpine.js integration for lightweight interactions.

# Test Strategy:
✅ VERIFIED: Tailwind CSS static files compile correctly and load without 404 errors. Test user detail page routing resolves properly. Next: Validate character management forms work with HTMX for create/read/update/delete operations. Confirm guild roster dashboard displays properly with filtering and search functionality. Test component library elements render consistently across different screen sizes. Verify progressive enhancement works with and without JavaScript enabled. Test role-based UI elements display correctly for different user types.
