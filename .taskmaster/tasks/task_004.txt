# Task ID: 4
# Title: Character Management System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create Character model with CRUD operations and user associations
# Details:
Create Character model with name (unique), class, level, rank, status fields and ForeignKey to User. Implement character reassignment between users. Create Rank model with hierarchy. Set up main/alt character relationships via self-referencing ForeignKey. Create ownership history tracking model. Implement Django admin interface and DRF ViewSets with proper serializers.

# Test Strategy:
Test character CRUD operations, user associations, reassignment functionality, and ownership history tracking

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Character model with basic fields and user relationships [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core Character model with essential fields like name, description, creation date, and establish foreign key relationship to User model
### Details:
Create Character model in models.py with fields: name (CharField), description (TextField), created_at (DateTimeField), updated_at (DateTimeField), user (ForeignKey to User). Include proper string representation and basic model validation.

Implementation completed successfully. Created Character model in new 'raiders' Django app with enhanced field set including name (unique), character_class, level, status enum (active/inactive/retired/alt), user ForeignKey, description, is_active boolean, and timestamp fields. Added database indexes for performance optimization and configured Django admin interface for easy management. Database migrations generated and applied without issues. The model is now ready for use with proper validation and admin functionality.

## 2. Implement Rank model and hierarchy system [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create Rank model with hierarchical structure and associate it with Character model
### Details:
Create Rank model with fields: name, level (IntegerField for hierarchy), description. Add rank field to Character model as ForeignKey. Implement ordering and validation for rank hierarchy levels.
<info added on 2025-07-08T04:28:56.421Z>
Implementation completed successfully with enhanced features beyond initial requirements. The Rank model includes additional fields for permissions (JSONField) and color coding (hex field) with timestamps for better tracking. Django admin interface provides visual rank representation with color displays and character count statistics. Database migrations properly handle the rank hierarchy system with unique constraints on both name and level fields. The Character model's rank relationship uses SET_NULL deletion behavior to preserve character data when ranks are removed.

## 3. Implement main/alt character relationships via self-referencing ForeignKey [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Add self-referencing relationship to Character model to support main character and alternate character associations
### Details:
Add main_character field to Character model as ForeignKey('self') with null=True, blank=True. Add related_name='alt_characters' to enable reverse lookup. Include methods to get main character and all alternates.
<info added on 2025-07-08T04:30:47.917Z>
Implementation completed successfully. Self-referencing ForeignKey added to Character model with SET_NULL on delete protection and 'alt_characters' related_name for reverse lookups. Helper properties implemented: is_main (checks if main_character is None), is_alt (checks if main_character exists), and navigation methods: get_main_character() returns self or main character, get_all_alts() returns queryset of alternates, get_character_family() returns combined main+alts queryset. Django admin enhanced with character type display showing 'Main (X alts)' or 'Alt of [name]' and autocomplete widget for main_character selection. Database migrations created and applied without issues.

## 4. Create ownership history tracking model [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement CharacterOwnership model to track character ownership changes over time
### Details:
Create CharacterOwnership model with fields: character (ForeignKey to Character), previous_owner (ForeignKey to User), new_owner (ForeignKey to User), transfer_date (DateTimeField), reason (TextField). Add indexes for efficient querying.
<info added on 2025-07-08T04:32:44.778Z>
Implementation completed successfully. The CharacterOwnership model has been fully developed with comprehensive tracking capabilities including nullable previous_owner for initial character creation, auto-timestamped transfer dates, and structured reason choices (created/manual/inactive/left_guild/returned/other). Added validation logic to prevent invalid same-user transfers and created a helper method record_transfer() for streamlined transfer operations. Django admin interface configured with enhanced visualization including transfer display, date hierarchy navigation, and comprehensive search/filter functionality. Database performance optimized with strategic indexes on commonly queried fields. All migrations have been generated and successfully applied to the database.

## 5. Implement Django admin interface and DRF ViewSets with serializers [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Create comprehensive admin interface and REST API endpoints for all character-related models
### Details:
Create admin.py with ModelAdmin classes for Character, Rank, and CharacterOwnership. Implement DRF serializers for all models with proper field validation. Create ViewSets with CRUD operations, filtering, and pagination. Include proper permissions and authentication.
<info added on 2025-07-08T04:36:05.325Z>
Implementation completed successfully. Django admin interface was already in place from previous subtasks with comprehensive ModelAdmin classes featuring custom displays, filters, search functionality, and optimized querysets for Character, Rank, and CharacterOwnership models. Built complete REST API with five serializers: RankSerializer for rank data, CharacterListSerializer for character listings, CharacterDetailSerializer for full character information, CharacterOwnershipSerializer for ownership records, and CharacterTransferSerializer for character transfers. Implemented ViewSets with staff-only permissions for destructive operations, custom actions including my_characters endpoint, family grouping, and transfer functionality. Added filtering capabilities by user and character type, plus ownership history tracking. All API endpoints are accessible at /api/raiders/ with full CRUD operations, proper authentication, and pagination support.
