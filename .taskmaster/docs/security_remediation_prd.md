# Security Remediation PRD - Kromrif Planning Application

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines critical security improvements identified during the comprehensive security audit of the Kromrif Planning Django application. The focus is on implementing defensive security measures to protect against common web application vulnerabilities and ensuring the application follows security best practices.

## Security Remediation Requirements

### 1. Dependency Security Management (CRITICAL)

**Requirement:** Implement comprehensive dependency vulnerability management
**Priority:** High
**Risk Level:** Critical

- Audit all Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Update vulnerable packages to secure versions
- Implement automated dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Establish regular dependency update schedule

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All high/critical CVEs in dependencies resolved
- pip-audit shows clean scan results
- Automated dependency checking integrated
- Documentation for dependency management process

### 2. API Rate Limiting Implementation (HIGH)

**Requirement:** Implement comprehensive rate limiting across all API endpoints
**Priority:** High  
**Risk Level:** Medium

- Add DRF throttling to all API endpoints
- Configure different rates for authenticated vs anonymous users
- Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
- Add rate limiting monitoring and alerting

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All API endpoints have appropriate throttling
- Brute force protection on auth endpoints
- Rate limiting configuration documented
- Monitoring dashboard for rate limit violations

### 3. CORS Security Configuration (HIGH)

**Requirement:** Secure CORS configuration for production deployment
**Priority:** High
**Risk Level:** Medium

- Configure explicit allowed origins for production
- Remove wildcard CORS permissions
- Implement proper CORS headers
- Test CORS configuration with frontend

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Explicit CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS configured
- No wildcard origins in production
- Proper CORS headers implemented
- Frontend integration tested

### 4. API Input Validation Enhancement (MEDIUM)

**Requirement:** Strengthen API input validation and sanitization
**Priority:** Medium
**Risk Level:** Medium

- Review all API serializers for comprehensive validation
- Implement input sanitization for complex endpoints
- Add validation for bulk operations
- Implement proper error handling for invalid input

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All API endpoints have comprehensive validation
- Bulk operations properly validate all inputs
- Input sanitization implemented where needed
- Error handling doesn't leak sensitive information

### 5. External Resource Security (MEDIUM)

**Requirement:** Secure external resource loading with SRI
**Priority:** Medium
**Risk Level:** Low

- Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN scripts
- Review all external resource dependencies
- Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
- Consider self-hosting critical JavaScript libraries

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- All external scripts use SRI hashes
- CSP headers properly configured
- External dependencies documented
- Fallback mechanisms for CDN failures

### 6. Admin Interface Security (MEDIUM)

**Requirement:** Secure Django admin interface for production
**Priority:** Medium
**Risk Level:** Low

- Implement additional admin authentication measures
- Add admin activity logging
- Review admin permissions and access

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Production admin URL is non-standard
- Admin access properly logged
- Multi-factor authentication considered
- Admin permissions reviewed and documented

### 7. Security Monitoring Implementation (LOW)

**Requirement:** Implement comprehensive security monitoring
**Priority:** Low
**Risk Level:** Informational

- Add security event logging
- Implement failed login monitoring
- Add suspicious activity detection
- Create security monitoring dashboard

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Security events properly logged

### 8. Secrets Management Improvement (LOW)

**Requirement:** Improve secrets management and rotation
**Priority:** Low  
**Risk Level:** Informational

- Implement proper secrets rotation procedures
- Review all hardcoded secrets and API keys
- Add secrets scanning to CI/CD pipeline
- Document secrets management procedures

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- No hardcoded secrets in codebase
