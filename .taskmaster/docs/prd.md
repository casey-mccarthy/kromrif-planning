# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# EQ DKP System Implementation

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a modern EQ DKP (Dragon Kill Points) system to serve as the **authoritative source of truth** for guild roster management, integrating with Discord bot services for automated role management. The system will include comprehensive character tracking, DKP point accrual, events/raids management, loot distribution tracking, and a recruitment application system for prospective guild members.

**Key Design Decision**: Following the rank refactoring, characters do not have ranks, groups, or roles - only Discord users have role assignments through the `role_group` field.

## 2. Implementation Options

The system can be implemented using either:
- **Django + Django REST Framework (DRF)** - Full-featured web framework with admin interface
- **FastAPI + SQLAlchemy** - High-performance API-first approach with automatic documentation

Both implementations share the same core business logic and database schema, differing primarily in framework-specific features and development approach.

## 3. Core System Requirements

  3. Trial acceptance
  4. Member voting period (48 hours)
  5. Final approval/rejection

#### Voting System
- Attendance-based voting eligibility (â‰¥15% 30-day attendance)
- Vote options: pass, fail, recycle
- Vote counting rules:
  - Accept votes from all eligible members
  - Count only votes from members with sufficient attendance
- Role-based vote visibility:
  - Members/Developers: See vote totals only
  - Recruiters/Officers: See individual votes and attendance breakdown

#### Application Comments
- Internal officer comments
- Applicant feedback system
- Comment visibility controls

### 3.7 Discord Integration
**Priority: High**

#### Role Synchronization

- Automatic Discord role assignment based on User.role_group
- Sync failure logging and retry mechanisms
- Manual sync override capabilities

#### Bot Integration
- Raid attendance collection
- Bidding system integration
- Application notifications
- Role change announcements

### 3.8 Analytics and Reporting
**Priority: Medium**

#### Attendance Analytics
- Rolling 30/60/90 day attendance percentages
- Lifetime attendance tracking
- Voting eligibility calculations
- Performance trend analysis

#### DKP Analytics
- Point balance distributions
- Spending pattern analysis
